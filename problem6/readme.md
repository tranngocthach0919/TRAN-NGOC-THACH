# Score Update Module Specification

## Overview
This module handles user score updates for a live leaderboard system. It processes authenticated score update requests, updates the scores atomically in Redis, maintains a queue of updates for persistence, and triggers real-time leaderboard updates via WebSockets.

## System Components
- **Client**: User-facing application that sends score update requests
- **API Service**: Handles authentication, validation, and orchestrates the score update flow
- **Redis**: Serves as both a cache for fast score lookups and a queue for pending updates
- **Worker Service**: Processes queued score updates and persists them to the database
- **Database**: Permanent storage for user scores and related data
- **WebSocket Service**: Broadcasts leaderboard updates to connected clients

## Score Update Flow

1. User completes an action in the client application
2. Client sends a `POST /api/v1/scores/update` request to the API Service
3. API Service authenticates the request and validates the score update
4. API Service uses Redis ZINCRBY command to atomically update the user's score
5. Redis returns the updated score
6. API Service adds the update to a Redis queue using LPUSH
7. API Service sends a confirmation to the client
8. API Service uses ZRANGE to get the top 10 scores from Redis
9. API Service sends the updated leaderboard to the WebSocket Service
10. WebSocket Service broadcasts the updated leaderboard to all connected clients
11. Asynchronously, the Worker Service continuously:
    - Pops updates from the Redis queue using BRPOP
    - Processes the score update data
    - Performs batch writes to the database
12. Periodically (optional), the Worker Service:
    - Fetches complete leaderboard data from the database
    - Updates the Redis cache to ensure consistency

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/v1/scores/update
Updates a user's score after completing an action.

**Request Headers:**
- `Authorization`: Bearer token for user authentication

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "userId": "string",
  "actionId": "string",
  "scoreIncrement": "number",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601 string"
}
```

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "userId": "string",
  "newScore": "number",
  "rank": "number (optional)",
  "leaderboard": [
    {
      "userId": "string",
      "username": "string",
      "score": "number",
      "rank": "number"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- 401 Unauthorized: Invalid or missing authentication token
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid request parameters
- 403 Forbidden: User is not authorized to perform this action
- 429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded
- 500 Internal Server Error: Server-side error

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All score update requests must include a valid authentication token
2. **Request Validation**:
   - Verify the `actionId` is valid and can be performed by the user
   - Validate that the `scoreIncrement` adheres to predefined rules for the action
   - Check for duplicate action submissions using a time-based window
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. **Action Verification**: Implement a verification system to ensure the action was legitimately completed
5. **Data Integrity**: Use transaction logs and periodic consistency checks between Redis and the database

## Redis Data Structures

1. **Sorted Set for Leaderboard**:
   - Key: `leaderboard`
   - Members: User IDs
   - Scores: User scores
   
2. **List for Update Queue**:
   - Key: `score:updates:queue`
   - Values: Serialized score update objects

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Atomicity**: Use Redis transactions where appropriate to ensure atomic operations
2. **Performance**:
   - Optimize database batch writes for performance
   - Use connection pooling for Redis and database connections
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed database writes
   - Log all errors with appropriate context
4. **Monitoring**:
   - Track queue depth and processing latency
   - Set up alerts for abnormal patterns
5. **Testing**:
   - Create comprehensive test cases, including edge cases
   - Test for race conditions and concurrent updates

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Implement a TTL (Time To Live) for cached leaderboard data
   - Consider separate leaderboards for different time periods (daily, weekly, all-time)

2. **Scaling**:
   - Add support for Redis Cluster for horizontal scaling
   - Implement sharding strategy for large user bases

3. **Fraud Detection**:
   - Add anomaly detection for suspicious score patterns
   - Implement cooldown periods between certain types of actions

4. **Resilience**:
   - Add circuit breakers between services
   - Implement graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable

5. **Real-time Enhancements**:
   - Add support for user-specific notifications when their rank changes
   - Implement leaderboard categories or filters

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Consider using Redis Streams instead of Lists for the update queue
   - Explore using Redis Pipeline for batched operations

7. **Observability**:
   - Add distributed tracing across the entire flow
   - Implement detailed metrics for each component
